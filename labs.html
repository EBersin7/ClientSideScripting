                        <h1>Lab 1 - HTML Home Page with CSS</h1>

                        <p>
                            My experience with HTML, CSS, javascript/jquery, and client side frameworks before this class was
                            just barely above zero. The farthest I had gone before with HTML was clicking 'View page source' on a website and even
                            that was just an accident. The coding that I saw in HTML and javascript was familiar looking because of my
                            prior CS classes, but it was still not something I believed I had a firm grasp on. Actual experience
                            working in this field for this lab opened my eyes on the wide range of possibilities and control developers have
                            over HTML documents.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I used several advanced techniques within this lab. One that immediately stands out on my page is the gradient
                            effect on the content block. Casting it from white to light blue, it gives a look of gently fading color. Another
                            special style I used was shadowing. By setting a color and pixel size, I was able to give both the header and the
                            content block a small shadow effect underneath them. This helps create the illusion that the boxes are actually 3D
                            and hovering over the background image.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I learned a lot in this lab, mainly everything a beginner needs to start work with HTML. One thing I picker up quickly
                            was the use of tags in the language to create specialized sections. This led to research on the various tags that can
                            be employed and what their general purpose is. The second big thing I learned was how a CSS works in the framework of
                            a page. I was initially overwhelmed by the sheer number of options for design presented, but the naming conventions
                            and common sense used in their functionality helped ease the learning process. Lastly, I learned how the angular directives
                            and references allow for simple reuse of common code fragments. This makes designing a cohesive website much less work intensive.
                        </p>

                        <h1>Lab 2 - JavaScript Animation</h1>

                        <p>
                            The lab for this week involved using JavaScript to create a page with animation. Following up on my
                            Super Mario theme, I took this opportunity to animate a sprite sheet of Mario himself from Super
                            Mario Bros. 2. The Italian plumber can be made to run across the screen by pressing the "Move Mario"
                            button on the animation page. When he reaches the green pipe, he disappears and reappears on the other
                            end, true to his games. The other buttons on the page can be used to advance Mario frame by frame or to
                            stop his run. Pressing the "Move Mario" button multiple times will increase his speed, but will require
                            a page refresh to stop him.
                        </p>

                        <p>  
                            I have previously taken several Java courses so I expected to be in familiar ground with JavaScript.
                            However, there were a variety of differences which were surprising. The first big one is that variables
                            did not need to have a type declared, they could accept and form to anything they were given. The other
                            thing that I learned about was assigning buttons in the HTML to functions in the JavaScript. It was much
                            simpler in JavaScript compared to Java which requires event handling, listeners, and GUI interaction.

                        </p>

                        <h1>Lab 3 - jQuery Alternate Home Page</h1>

                        <p>
                            For this lab, we had to make use of jQuery to add effects and events to a page.
                            I created a separate CSS to work on this and started with my original home page as
                            a base. I edited colors and changed the content so that the formatting would be slightly
                            different, but still familiar. The biggest changes come from the scripted events such the
                            links which move when hovered over. An image can be found in the center of the screen and when
                            clicked on it expands. Instructions for other effects can be found in a fading content box.

                        </p>

                        <h1>Lab 4 - Bootstrap Designed Page</h1>

                        <p>
                            In this lab, I created a newly designed page for my website's Mario theme. Using bootstrap, I was able
                            to create a simple, but professional looking product sales page. The biggest point of this new design is
                            that it is responsive to browser changes. The page can resize/reorder itself to suit mobile devices and
                            larger screens smoothly. A specific component that is possible because of bootstrap is the row class. This
                            class allowed me to create 3 separate panels for a product comparison side by side. The panels will stack
                            on top of each other when the screen is shrunk. Another component that I used was the navbar. Design features
                            in the navbar allow the links to become a drop down menu when the window is too small. This adds to the
                            adaptability of the website design.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The layout I like best is the Blackbox. The page design incorporates many elements, but it keeps the
                            text sections very clean. Colors used are vivid without being too flashy. Browser changes cause certain images
                            within the page to bounce off the wall and shake. Standard switch action, like divs stacking on top of each
                            other when shrunk are also present.

                        </p>

                        <h1>Lab 5 - MySQL Workbench Database</h1>

                        <p>
                            In this lab, I worked with MySQL Workbench to design, implement, and populate a database. I also wrote several
                            SQL SELECT statements to display the information in various ways. The database I created consisted of three different
                            tables: User_Role, User_Info, and TV_Shows. Each table was designed with relevant and required information as outlined
                            in the lab document. The query statements I coded ordered the tables by either their name column or title column.
                            Certain selectors allowed for the total data table to be limited to only the records that met the requirements.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The main components of this lab, including a data model that was reverse engineered from the database, have
                            all been pictured and posted into a word document for viewing convenience.

                        <h1>Lab 6 - WebAPI and AJAX</h1>

                        <p>
                            This lab made use of last week's database lab to design a web API and implement a simple search function.
                            We made use of AJAX function calls in our search queries and then displayed a table result from the database specified parameters. The DOM was modified in two different ways: through
                            JavaScript and through jQuery. Libraries in JSON were also used in conjunction with a MySQL connector.

                        </p>

                        <h1>Lab 7 - AngularJS Search</h1>

                        <p>
                            The lab this week invoked the web API we created last week to display information from our database in a sortable format.
                            By using AngularJS, the table created on page load can be filtered by user input. Terms entered into the search
                            box will limit the elements in the table to only those containing the search string. Each column of the table can be
                            clicked on to sort the entire table by alphabetical order of that column. A consecutive click on the column name will
                            reverse the order of the table based on the field. A small, unexpected (or possibly expected) result is that the search
                            box will also look through the image URL to find a match. The only way I found to remedy this was to have a search box
                            for each field. However, I found this to be too complex and ugly design-wise, so I left it simple and included instructions
                            for use.

                        <h1>Tutorial - ScrollMagic</h1>

                        <p>
                            I created a tutorial page for the JavaScript library, ScrollMagic. The library is capable
                            of animating and modifying HTML elements in a multitude of ways. Using a simple design, its
                            two classes, Controller and Scene, are setup and implemented very straight forward. The library
                            is compatible with jQuery, GSAP, and VelocityJS, but also supports just JavaScript with CSS and HTML.
                            Simple examples are given for each area and they are all built upon previous sections.

                        <h1>AngularJS Triple Lab Part 1</h1>

                        <p>
                            This lab is part one of my AngularJS CRUD implementation. By using our existing web API and adding a few new
                            ones, Create and Delete functions work on my database table. I learned a lot about how you can manipulate
                            database information through client side AngularJS and server side APIs. An element has been deleted and
                            a test element has been inserted already.

                        <h1>AngularJS Triple Lab Part 2</h1>

                        <p>
                            This lab is part two of my AngularJS CRUD implementation. This part required us to implement login/logoff
                            functionality for the user and the ability to update existing records. For this purpose, I added three more
                            JSP pages: update, login, and logoff. Each of these APIs required a corresponding function to be developed
                            in my section of JavaScript. Sections on the HTML site and buttons to send the AJAX calls were also added.
                            This lab casued a lot of problems for me, but the sample code I modified provided many error messages which
                            helped locate my problem each time.

                            This lab is the final part of my AngularJS CRUD implementation. This part required us to implement login/logoff
                            functionality which controlled the ability to edit and delete records. The angular directive ng-show was used in 
                            conjunction with a boolean to determine whether edit mode is enabled/viewable. Each of the prior functions were
                            extended slightly to handle the switching on and off by login. In the update and delete JSP pages, I added
                            a check on the user's email from the session. If the string returned was null, then the user was not logged in.
