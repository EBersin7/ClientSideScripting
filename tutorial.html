                <h1>Introduction to ScrollMagic</h1>

                <p>
                    Welcome to a beginner's guide to ScrollMagic! This JavaScript library offers a simple, but robust way
                    to add effects to your HTML page elements based on user scroll position.<br><br>
                    The library in its current version works with plain old JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. However, the library
                    can also be utilized through plugins available for jQuery, GSAP, and VelocityJS. For developers, this 
                    allows for customization and component extension.<br><br>
                    Some of the features provided for by the framework plugins include animation triggering, element pinning,
                    easy parallax effects, infinitely scrolling pages, and callback pinning.<br><br>
                    ScrollMagic works on object oriented principles just like normal JavaScript. It was designed to be lightweight, 
                    flexible, mobile compatible, and screen responsive among other things.<br><br>
                    Because of the tremendous depth of functionality provided by ScrollMagic, this tutorial will focus on the key concepts
                    in a few simple examples and provide alternate <br>resources for further learning.<br><br>
                </p>

                <h1>How To Get Started</h1>

                <p>
                    The first thing that must be done to start using ScrollMagic is to include the library in your code.
                    There are several ways to accomplish this as listed and described below. <br><br>
                    The recommended way is to use the Content Delivery Network as it does not require you to perform a
                    full download of the library. Also, it is possible that browser caching <br>occurs for users which speeds up page load. <br><br>
                    Plugins required for specific frameworks/libraries will be provided and discussed in their respective sections.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Content Delivery Network - <mark>https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ScrollMagic/2.0.5/ScrollMagic.js</mark>
                        <br>To use the CDN, you must include the above code in a script tag with the source set to the link.
                        <br>Place the finished product in your head section and it should look something like this:
                        <br><img src="example1.png" alt="e1"><br><br></li>

                    <li>Github Download - <mark><a href ="https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic/releases">Full Source</a></mark>
                        <br>To make use of the full library download, you must include it in your project's library folder.
                        <br>Then you should declare its usage with a script tag in your page like this:
                        <br><img src="example2.png" alt="e1"><br><br></li>

                    <li>Node Package Manager - <mark>$ npm install scrollmagic</mark>
                        <br>To use NPM, you must already have the program installed on your device.
                        <br>The official developer site can be found <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" >here</a> with instructions on how to download.
                        <br>After NPM is working, you can enter the above command line call to install the library.
                        <br>Then you should declare its usage in the same way as above. The following snippet uses the minified version:
                        <br><img src="example3.png" alt="e1"><br><br></li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    There is one last download that is highly recommended before starting. It is the debugging plugin.<br>
                    <br>This plugin will allow you to see markings on the scroll bar to know when events should trigger.<br>
                    <br>It also provides extra functions which enable you to print pertinent debug info to the console.<br>
                    <br>The CDN is provided for simplicity, but the full library download and include method works as well:
                    <br><mark>http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ScrollMagic/2.0.5/plugins/debug.addIndicators.js</mark>
                </p>

                <h1>How Does It Work</h1>

                <p>
                    The basic idea behind the library is the use of a Controller object and Scene objects. The controller
                    becomes the manager and activator of effects to given scenes.<br>
                    <br>The scenes determine and describe to the controller what effects to apply and when. Each scene can
                    reference an HTML element through CSS selectors or<br> remain blank to trigger at the top of the page.<br>
                    <br>Enter the body section of your HTML page and create a script tag at the bottom. With the script towards
                    the end, the rest of the HTML is given a chance to load<br> before running animation.
                    In the JavaScript, create a variable to represent the controller and then create a new ScrollMagic
                    Controller object:
                    <br><img src="example4.png" alt="e1"><br><br>

                    It is possible to set properties for all scenes by modifying the controller object on instantiation.
                    However, like with CSS, properties redefined<br> later by scenes will overwrite anything set here:
                    <br><img src="example7.png" alt="e1"><br><br>

                    The controller is now created and will be linked to the browser scrollbar. Now, we can begin creating
                    scenes for the newly created controller.<br>
                    For this task, we will create another variable to represent the scene and then we will create a new
                    ScrollMagic Scene object:
                    <br><img src="example5.png" alt="e1"><br><br>

                    At this point, we can style the scene variable with a variety of properties. These properties will be
                    placed into the Scene constructor as a JavaScript object.<br>
                    The syntax of the object is similar to what you would see in a CSS element. <br>In the following example,
                    several of the most important properties are applied and described:
                    <br><img src="example6.png" alt="e1"><br><br>

                    Finally, the scene can be given to the controller and connected. There are several ways to add the scene
                    to the controller for management. They are detailed as follows:
                    <br><img src="example8.png" alt="e1"><br><br>

                    Before leaving the basics, it would be helpful to point out indicators. If you are using the debugging plugin,
                    you can add marks to the scroll bar to indicate when an event should trigger.
                    This can be a very helpful tool when it comes to resolving issues in your code. The addition of these ticks,
                    <br><img src="example9.png" alt="e1"><br>
                    is performed by tacking on the following function during scene creation:
                    <br><img src="example10.png" alt="e1"><br><br>
                </p>

                <h1>CSS Class Toggling</h1>

                <p>
                    Class toggling with ScrollMagic is a way to change the appearance of your HTML elements using just CSS
                    and JavaScript. In simple terms, you will define several styles<br> for a particular item.
                    Then, by using nested classes inside of your CSS element description, you can switch between
                    several looks for a given element.<br>
                    <br>This functionality is similar to the effects provided for by other libraries including jQuery.
                    The difference is that instead of calling pre-defined functions, you will write your whole, specific
                    style for each item to toggle. This allows a larger range of control over the look and feel of your effects
                    while maintaining a higher degree of simplicity.<br><br>

                    To start on this method, we will first create two sections to mess with and adjust:
                    <br><img src="example11.png" alt="e1"><br><br>

                    Next we will need a style area to control the look of the two boxes:
                    <br><img src="example12.png" alt="e1"><br><br>

                    At this point, the first box will appear red and the second box will appear blue. To implement the toggle,
                    we must now put in a style to switch over to:
                    <br><img src="example13.png" alt="e1"><br><br>

                    Now, we create the scene objects, call the setClassToggle method, and add the scenes to the controller.
                    Any properties set in the scene will determine when the toggle triggers.<br>
                    This example will cause the boxes to change their color to orange/purple when the scrollbar reaches the halfway point
                    of the specified element:
                    <br><img src="example14.png" alt="e1"><br><br>

                    The setClassToggle method uses the given parameters to determine where to look for the class to switch on.
                    The style defined in the CSS determines how the transition will occur. <br><br>
                    A simple example can be located <a href="toggle.html">here</a>
                </p>

                <h1>jQuery</h1>

                <p>
                    jQuery is a very popular JavaScript library which supports a multitude of HTML manipulating functions.
                    With methods designed for animation and event handling,<br> jQuery uses similar concepts as ScrollMagic.<br>
                    <br>However, the connection to the scrollbar and event triggering is done entirely through the Controller
                    abstraction whereas in jQuery much more explicit code is<br> required to achieve the same effect.<br>
                    <br>With all that said, ScrollMagic supports the usage of jQuery and can incorporate several helpful
                    functions into its code.
                    <br>To get started, use this CDN to add the jQuery library to your project:
                    <br><mark>https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js</mark><br><br>

                    Minor changes can now be made to the code, for instance, compare this chunk of code, to the original
                    declaration of the controller:
                    <br><img src="example15.png" alt="e1"><br><br>

                    Both creations of the controller complete the same task, but the jQuery one uses a function to work
                    with the given HTML element.<br><br>

                    A useful function that comes from the inclusion of jQuery is the each function. This allows you to
                    cycle through all the parts of a specific item in your HTML.<br>
                    The each function used below, demonstrates how many scenes can be created and added to a controller
                    by iterating through the class:
                    <br><img src="example16.png" alt="e1"><br><br>

                    A final important thing to know about using jQuery with ScrollMagic is the ability to create your own functions.
                    Using the general format here,
                    <br><img src="example17.png" alt="e1"><br><br>
                    it is possible to extend the abilities of both libraries with scene creation and customization.
                </p>

                <h1>GSAP</h1>

                <p>
                    GreenSock Animation Plugin is one of the plugins that ScrollMagic can utilize to extend its capabilities
                    and create professional looking animation. Able to touch and move any object created in JavaScript,
                    GSAP offers an easy to use interface for ScrollMagic to adapt.<br><br>

                    To use GSAP, it is also required that you have jQuery in your code. The full source block for GSAP, jQuery,
                    and ScrollMagic is here:
                    <br><img src="example18.png" alt="e1"><br><br>

                    The main usage covered here will be that of Tweens. The Tween class will be used to create variables
                    that can be animated when passed an HTML element.<br>
                    For this simple example, we will focus on moving an item to a new location. That purpose is handled
                    by the following related functions: 
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>from - animate FROM the entered location to the default value in the style sheet</li>
                    <li>to - animate TO the entered location from the default value in the style sheet</li>
                    <li>fromTo - animate FROM one entered location TO a second entered location</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    To keep it simple, we will assume all previous code has been reused up to this point. Now, we
                    wish to create a variable for the Tween and setup the from function on it. This moves the box
                    from the given position to whatever is declared in the style sheet:
                    <br><img src="example19.png" alt="e1"><br><br>

                    Finally, we use our scene creation to set the tween and add it to the controller:
                    <br><img src="example20.png" alt="e1"><br><br>

                    The finished product causes the box1 element to move from the bottom left of the screen to
                    the spot set in the original style sheet. This event is triggered when the user scrolls far enough
                    down to enter the element. <br><br>
                    An example can be located <a href="gsap.html">here</a>
                </p>
                <h1>VelocityJS</h1>

                <p>
                    Velocity.js is an animation engine that is closely related to GSAP. Velocity
                    does not need jQuery to work, but it can also make use of it if you so wish.<br>
                    <br>As you could expect, Velocity also requires a CDN to use the plugin:<br>
                    <mark>https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/velocity/1.3.1/velocity.min.js</mark><br><br>

                    There is a considerable amount of overlap between the setup to use GSAP and to use Velocity.
                    To avoid redundancy, I will only describe and explain the critical section that varies.<br>

                    In the following code snippet, the GSAP call to set the Tween is replace by the call to set the
                    Velocity. The arguments for the call are first the element to be animated and then the list of
                    animations to be performed:
                    <br><img src="example21.png" alt="e1"><br><br>

                    Given all other previous aspects are implemented properly, the use of Velocity above will cause
                    the second box to disappear when the first box is triggered.
                </p>
