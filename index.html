                            Tokyo 2020 Olympic preview this year. The background of this site features the first level of the classic
                            Super Mario Bros. game. Read on for more on his history and for links to neat Nintendo sites.

                            The Super Mario franchise is a massive media franchise primarily consisting of video games published and produced by Nintendo starring
                            the fictional Italian character Mario. The franchise's other largest forms of media include several television series 
                            and a feature film. It was originally created by game designer Shigeru Miyamoto with the arcade game Donkey Kong, 
                            released on July 9, 1981. The games have been developed by a variety of developers including Nintendo, 
                            Hudson Soft, and AlphaDream. Most Mario games have either been released for the arcade or Nintendo video 
                            game consoles and handhelds dating from the Nintendo Entertainment System to the current generation of video game consoles.

                            The main series in the franchise is the Super Mario platform series, which mostly follows Mario's adventures in the 
                            fictional world of the Mushroom Kingdom. These games typically rely on Mario's jumping ability to allow him to progress
                            through levels. Analysts suggest that by 2012, the Mario franchise was valued at over $10 billion. The franchise has 
                            spawned over 200 games of various genres. The entire franchise, including series such as Super Mario, Mario Kart, Mario Party,
                            Mario Tennis, and Mario Golf, have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling video game franchise of all time.
